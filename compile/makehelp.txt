##### Using the OpenAtom build system #####
#
#Some useful command-line features:
#
# make -jN v=<verbose-level> where=<build-dir-location> builddir=<build-dir-name-prefix> [otherflags]
#
#      -jN
#        Extent of build parallelization. Parallel builds are faster. Refer GNU make docs
#
#      v=<verbose-level>
#        A number between 0 and 2. Higher is more verbose. Default: 0
#
#      where=<build-dir-location>
#        Where to place the build directory. Relative or absolute path. Default: project root
#
#      builddir=<build-dir-name-prefix>
#        What prefix to use for the name of the build directory. Default: build
#
#      [otherflags]
#        You can set other flags controlling the build on the command line
#        itself, instead of setting them in the configuration file.
#        For eg:
#           make CXXFLAGS+=-verbose to make the charmc compiler really verbose
#           make OPT=-g to compiler with debugging on
#           make CHARMBASE=<some-path> to use some specific charm installation
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#- The makefile to be invoked by users is in the project root directory
#
#- The makefile with machine-specific configurations (config.mk) also needs to
#  be copied to the project root from the makefiles directory.
#
#- Flags and make variables for controlling any portion of the build can be set
#  in this configuration file or on the command line.
#
#- This location of the build directory is by default at the root of the
#  OpenAtom project. You can change this by specifying the variable 'where' on
#  your make command line. This path can be a relative or absolute path and can
#  be located anywhere in your filesystem independent of the location of the
#  OpenAtom directory. Of course, you'll need write permissions. The build
#  directory will be created inside 'where'.
