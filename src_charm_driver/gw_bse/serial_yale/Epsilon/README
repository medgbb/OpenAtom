How to run this program:

executable : epsilon

input file : gw.input


input variable description:

At this moment, reading input file is not smart. 
OpenAtom provides a nice input tool, so we did not want to invent anything special for this serial code.
The order of input options is following:

wfnFFTsize     # double, determines the size of the FFT for wavefunction and polarizability. This is expressed as a fraction of full FFT size (dense FFT when calculating density). For example, if the dense FFT size is 100 * 100 * 100 and wfnFFTsize is 0.5, the FFT size will be chosen by 50 * 50 * 50.
EpsCut         # double,  epsilon cutoff in Ry unit  -> check if it is really in Ry unit
shift[0], shift[1], shift[2] # double,  shift vector for epsilon matrix calculation, unit: 1/(2pi/alat) a.u.^-1
iter_maxiter   # integer, number of maximum iteration
iter_convg     # double, iteration convergence
