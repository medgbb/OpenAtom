Flow of the code and What each function calculates:

read_usrinput(USRINPUT &):
	It reads input options from a gw.input file.

read_sysinfo(SYSINFO &):
	It reads system information from Quantum Espresso. 
		lattice constant (in bohr unit)
		lattice vectors (in bohr unit)
		reciprocal lattice vectors (unit: 1/(2pi/alat) a.u.^-1 so 2pi/alatt should be multiplied to get the real one)
		number of spin, number of kpoints, number of total states
		number of planewaves at each k points 
		k vectors (unit: 1/(2pi/alat) a.u.^-1 so 2pi/alat should be multiplied to get the real one. 
		           Note that this is in cartesian unit. not crystal unit.)
		
	cartesian_to_crystal: calculating k vectors in crystal unit. 
			      The basis is reciprocal lattice vectors, which has the unit of 1/(2pi/alat) a.u.^-1)

	calc_qvec: calculating q vectors in crystal basis.

	calc_vol: calculating volume of the simulation cell.
