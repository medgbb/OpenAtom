This serial code computes the Screened exchange part of GW-selfenergy. At present, at q=0,
 coulb(q=0) is hardcoded for silicon (in sigma.f90). The input should be the 
 same wavefuction that was used to compute epsilon inverse matrix. Here wfn.dat* and in are the inputs.  
The number of bands that are asked for computing sigma is an input option. 
In this code, you can change the number of bands for sigma, just by changing the ib -indices inside sigma.f90
To change eps_cutoff, please change manually in usrinput.f90. 
The same value of eps_cut that was used to compute epsilon inverse matrix, should be used here.  
Typically the convergence for epsilon inverse with eps_cut is similar to the convergence for Screened 
exchange.

To run this code we need eps_inv from epsilon calculation (phase III) obtained at q-vectors.
All the q-vectors have to match with epsilon calculation. 
For example, if you have 8 q-points, you need epsilon inverse seperately for each q-point. 
Like EPS_INV_1, EPS_INV_2 .. etc.
