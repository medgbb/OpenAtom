This serial code computes Bare exchange part of GW-selfenergy. At present, at q=0,
 coulb(q=0) is hardcoded for silicon (in sigma.f90). The input should be the 
 same wavefuction that was used to compute epsilon inverse matrix. Here wfn.dat* and in are the inputs.  
For Bare-exchange you don't need  epsilon inverse, but you still need to use the same wfn  to run
this code. 
Typically the number of bands that are asked for computing sigma is an input option. 
In this code, you can change the number of bands for sigma, just by changing the ib -indices inside sigma.f90
