This is the old converter.
Previously it worked for QE 5.0 / 5.1
but they have changed the main module that the converter utilizes, so I modified this old converter
so that it works for QE 5.3 and later version.

So... if you want to run this converter, you should use QE 5.3 or later version.

This converter writes wavefunctions into a single file (similar to Berkeley GW converter)
This converted wavefunction should be used for FORTRAN serial code. NOT FOR C++ CODE!!!

How to use:

Add these lines into Makefile in PP/src directory of QE, then type make old_converter.x

old_converter.x: ../../Modules/qexml.o save_QEwfn.o
        $(LD) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ save_QEwfn.o ../../Modules/qexml.o $(QEOBJS) $(LIBOBJS)


Run this executable with the input file. (Input file example is in this directory)
